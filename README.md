# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Lakshya Pawar

I am a self-motivated B.Tech IT student (8.32 CGPA) with a keen interest in Data Analytics and Cloud Computing. I'm a Deloitte Hacksplosion 2025 finalist with hands-on experience in real-world tech challenges, gained during a summer internship at Deloitte. My skills include MySQL, C++, Data Structures & Algorithms, Python, and RESTful API design with MuleSoft and Salesforce. I'm currently focused on improving my problem-solving skills to bridge the gap between finance and technology.
